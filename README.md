Hello! I'm Dr. Rubisco, but my friends call me Doc. This name and account is the one I use for and associate with my Mojang Account/Xbox Account for purposes related to Minecraft. I try to avoid linking these accounts to my personal accounts whenever possible, so please refrain from personal inquiries. My Mojang account username is Dr_Rubisco (DOCK-tore Rue-BEECE-coe), but pretty much any other account associated with this alias (full list below) uses the username 'thedocruby', so I will often introduce myself as "Dr. Rubisco (@thedocruby)", as above.

I am a passionate programmer with deep roots in C and C++, and experience with many different C-family programming languages. I enjoy computer rendering programs, especially path tracing and other forms of ray tracing, and I may one day develop my own Path-traced Minecraft shaderpack. I also enjoy microcontroller programming and small engineering projects. For these I usually use products from Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and/or PJRC (my personal favorite). Further information about myself is categorized below:

**NOTE:** Unless otherwise stated, this entire document should be current to and current _only_ to the date of the last commit. If you would like me to update it, feel free to submit an issue.
